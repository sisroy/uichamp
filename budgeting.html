        <h2>Budgeting Basics</h2>
        <p>Budgeting is the process of creating a plan to spend your money. It involves tracking your income and expenses to ensure you can cover your needs while saving for your goals.</p>
        <h3>Key Steps to Budgeting:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Track Your Income:</strong> Identify all sources of income, including allowances, part-time jobs, or gifts. Keep a record of how much money you receive and when you receive it.</li>
            <li><strong>List Your Expenses:</strong> Make a list of all your expenses, including essentials like food, clothing, transportation, and any discretionary spending. Be thorough and include both regular and irregular expenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Create Categories:</strong> Group your expenses into categories to better understand where your money is going. Common categories include housing, utilities, groceries, transportation, entertainment, and savings.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Financial Goals:</strong> Determine what you want to achieve with your money, whether it's saving for a specific purchase, building an emergency fund, or investing for the future. Set specific, measurable goals with realistic timelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Make a Budget:</strong> Use your income and expense information to create a budget that allocates your money towards your priorities. Allocate a portion of your income to each expense category and ensure your total expenses do not exceed your total income.</li>
            <li><strong>Track Your Spending:</strong> Keep track of your spending regularly to ensure you're staying within your budget and adjust as needed. Use a budgeting app, spreadsheet, or notebook to record your expenses and compare them to your budgeted amounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Review and Adjust:</strong> Periodically review your budget and make adjustments as your financial situation or goals change. Monitor your progress towards your goals and make changes to your budget as needed to stay on track.</li>
        </ul>
