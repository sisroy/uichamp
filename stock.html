            <h2>What is the Stock Market?</h2>
            <p>The graph depicts the fluctuation of a hypothetical stock's price over time, with the x-axis representing time (in months) and the y-axis representing the value of the stock. The line on the graph connects data points representing the stock's price at different points in time, illustrating the trend of the stock's performance. This visualization helps investors analyze historical price movements to identify patterns and trends that may inform their investment decisions.            </p>

            <h2>What is the Stock Market?</h2>
            <p>The stock market is a platform where investors can buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. It allows companies to raise capital by selling ownership stakes to investors, and investors can profit from the success of these companies.</p>

            <h2>Risks of Investing in Stocks</h2>
            <p>While investing in stocks can offer the potential for high returns, it also comes with risks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> The value of stocks can fluctuate due to changes in market conditions, economic factors, or investor sentiment.</li>
                <li><strong>Company Risk:</strong> Individual companies can face challenges such as financial difficulties, management changes, or legal issues, which can affect the value of their stock.</li>
                <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Stocks can experience significant price swings in the short term, leading to potential losses for investors.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Some stocks may have low trading volumes, making it difficult to buy or sell shares at desired prices.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Major Factors Influencing Stock Prices</h2>
            <p>Stock prices are influenced by various factors, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Indicators:</strong> Economic data such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and consumer spending can impact investor confidence and stock prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Company Performance:</strong> Quarterly earnings reports, revenue growth, and profitability are key factors that can affect the value of a company's stock.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> Investor sentiment, news events, and market trends can influence buying and selling activity, leading to price fluctuations.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Changes in interest rates set by central banks can impact borrowing costs, corporate profits, and investment decisions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why Invest in Mutual Funds?</h2>
            <p>For beginner-level investors, mutual funds can be a safer and more diversified option compared to individual stocks. Here's why:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets, reducing the risk of losses from individual investments.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Management:</strong> Mutual funds are managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions on behalf of investors, leveraging their expertise and research to optimize returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Mutual funds are accessible to investors with smaller budgets, allowing them to invest in a diversified portfolio with relatively low initial investment amounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Most mutual funds offer daily liquidity, allowing investors to buy or sell shares at the current net asset value (NAV) without the need for individual stock trading.</li>
            </ul>
